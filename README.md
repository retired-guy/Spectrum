# Spectrum
A copy of Bellini (https://github.com/atisharma/bellini), with somewhat different visualizations.  
Tested for Squeezelite on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, with Hyperpixel 4" touchscreens, running Raspberry Pi OS Buster.
The binary file included above has been tested on this configuration.  No guarantee it will run on newer verions of Raspberry Pi OS without recompiling.

  Spectrum analyzer with bars and VU meter, similar to that of the RME ADI-2 DAC FS.
  DIN PPM meter split into two, similar to the meter on the Revox A-700.
  
config file needs to be located in ~/.config/spectrum/
